An ajax based translation plugin using the [Google Translate API](http://translate.google.com)

== Description ==
You can translate your wordpress blog post to 20 international languages without reloading the page. The page format is maintained including the images, links, bullets and numbering, etc. The biggest advantage is a SEO optimized link. For every translation page, you can Generate a page which gets indexed by all the major search engines. Even I have seen the Google Adsense Ads are shown in that particular languages often. This plugin creates static pages according to your blog permalink structure. The pages are translated using Google Translation Engine. **This plugin is still not updated for blog not using custom permalink**. This plugin generates pages automatically. To avoid getting banned temporarily by Google Translation engine, we cannot get all the pages translated at once. If the translation page is not  available, the user goes to the 404 error page which send an header to of 302 temprorarily moved and creates the translation page instantly.The user does not see the 404 error page. The links of pages which do not have translation done will have a rel = no follow tag so that search engines don't follow those links, but as soon as the page is created, the rel = nofollow tag is removed automatically.
